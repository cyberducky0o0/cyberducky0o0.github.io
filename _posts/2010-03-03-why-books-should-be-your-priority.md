Ever wondered how you can truly stay anonymous online ? I will be going over the steps you can do to ensure you stay as anonymous as possible. These steps are in priority order to get you anonymous as soon as you can.

## Guide, Step-by-Step:

1. Create an anonymous email

2. Have an anonymous phone number

3. Receive Amazon packages to an anonymous address using Amazon lock boxes

4. Make a fake AI generated profile picture 

5. Make numerous accounts for social media, LinkedIn, Facebook, instagram

6. This can be taken a step further and a family is created for this person

7. How choosing a random address can point to this fake person in PeopleSearch 

8. A voicemail can be added and a fake voice can be used 

9. The use of TOR, proxy chains, Tails OS, bootable USBs and FDE can be used

10. Ultimately to be truly anonymous you need to be in a different country than the one you are using the Sock Puppet in (Switzerland)
