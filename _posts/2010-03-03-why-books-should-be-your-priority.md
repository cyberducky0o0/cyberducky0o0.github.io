Ever wondered how you can truly stay anonymous online ? I will be going over the steps you can do to ensure you stay as anonymous as possible. These steps are in priority order to get you anonymous as soon as you can.

## Guide, Step-by-Step:

1. Create an anonymous email
2. Have an anonymous phone number
3. Receive Amazon packages to an anonymous address using Amazon lock boxes
4. Make a fake AI generated profile picture 
5. Make numerous accounts for social media, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram
6. This can be taken a step further and a family is created for this person
7. How choosing a random address can point to this fake person in People Search 
8. A voicemail can be added and a fake voice can be used 
9. The use of TOR, proxy chains, Tails OS, bootable USBs and FDE can be used
10. Ultimately to be truly anonymous you need to be in a different country than the one you are using the Sock Puppet in (Switzerland) 

## Create an anonymous email

S﻿tep one is to find yourself an anonymous identity. The best way to do this is through an end to end encrypted email service. Meaning that the company itself does not have access to the contents of your emails. 

E﻿ven if your emails are encrypted, the end user can still see them. Meaning if you were to be emailing someone of power, they would know what you sent. The other concern that comes with emailing is the location (ip address) of the sender. How do you keep this safe? \
\
\
T﻿he best way we can do this today is using TOR. The TOR network uses volunteer routers that will redirect your traffic in a proxy chain like manner. The recipient of your message will see the IP address of the last router that your traffic went through. 

The last point that I want to mention is data protection laws in the country of the email server. 



S﻿wizterland has some of the strictests data protection laws in the world. It is far more difficult to get access to the emails in a country like this compared to the U.S. 



W﻿ith all of this said, the best products on the market for this kind of work is Proton Mail and TOR.

P﻿roton Mail has what we have talked about: 

1﻿. m﻿ake an email that has e2e encryption

2﻿. has a tor site for anonymous access

3﻿. d﻿ata privacy laws  prevent the govt from requesting your emails in switzerland
